TASK 2:
Read & learn about Python Unit testing and Jenkins online. One reference link :
https://qxf2.com/blog/jenkins-python/
Write a unit test that connects to atg.world website. On proper loading of the website, the unit test should pass. If the website doesn’t load, the unit test should fail. Mention the steps as log or print statements happening at all times.
Host jenkins on your free server under a subdomain : jenkins.domainname.com and run/verify the unit test as pass|fail from jenkins. The “hello world” should still work on the www domain.
